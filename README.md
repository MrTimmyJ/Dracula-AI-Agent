## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dracula AI Agent is an interactive, full-stack AI chatbot trained on Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Originally built as a Hugging Face model, it has since been expanded into a production-ready FastAPI web service, hosted on an Ubuntu server with Nginx.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system combines a PyTorch-based GPT-style model (trained from scratch with tiktoken tokenization) and a frontend chat UI (“VampChat”) that allows users to converse with Dracula in real time. This project demonstrates expertise in machine learning, backend deployment, and AI-driven web applications.

🧩 Features

    📚 Custom GPT Model: Transformer-style architecture trained on full Dracula text.

    🔡 tiktoken Tokenization: GPT-2 compatible encoding for efficient batching.

    🔁 Training Pipeline: PyTorch training loop with checkpointing and evaluation.

    📈 Diagnostics: Real-time loss visualization with Matplotlib.

    🧛 Interactive Chat UI: Web frontend where users “talk with Dracula.”

    🌐 Web Deployment: FastAPI backend served directly, with NGINX handling static frontend files.  

    ⚡ Chat Integration: Frontend sends POST requests to FastAPI to generate Dracula’s responses in real time.

🔄 User Workflow

    Place the cleaned Dracula text into your data directory

    Run training with Python gpt_train.py

    Monitor training loss and visual plots

    Generate text samples using a provided prompt

    Save and load model checkpoints for further experimentation

⚙️ How It Works

🧠 Model Architecture

    GPT-style transformer with token and positional embeddings
    
    Trained with cross-entropy loss using AdamW
    
    Inference supports temperature/top-k sampling for varied outputs

📊 Tokenization & Data Pipeline

    tiktoken (GPT-2) encoding for efficient tokenization
    
    Text chunked into fixed-length context windows with stride
    
    PyTorch DataLoader batches/shuffles train/validation splits

🧪 Training & Evaluation

    Multi-epoch training with periodic validation passes
    
    Loss tracking and visualization for diagnostics
    
    Checkpoint save/load via torch.save / torch.load

🖥️ Backend API

    FastAPI endpoints (e.g., /generate) serve model inference
    
    JSON request/response schema for prompts and outputs
    
    CORS enabled for browser clients behind Nginx

💬 Frontend

    HTML/CSS/JavaScript chat UI (“VampChat”)
    
    Sends user prompts to the API; renders model replies (optionally streamed)
    
    Simple session controls (new chat/clear history)

🌐 Hosting & Deployment
    
    Deployed on Ubuntu with Nginx reverse proxying to the FastAPI app
    
    Nginx serves static frontend and proxies API requests
    
    Basic logging/monitoring for reliable production use
